## Overview

### Description

Tech Blog is a full stack, fully functioning web application that allows users to interact and share their thoughts on the latest trends in technology. It has a back end with a database to store all users creditentials to login, posts, and comments on other posts.

## My process

### Built with

- Bootstrap/HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Express.js
- Node.js
- Sequelize
- MySQL2
- Handlebars.js

### What I learned

I finally learned how to make a full stack web app. I learned how to use Express.js to transfer information along side a database made with MySQL2 and Sequelize. I learned how to make a changing front en using Handlebars.js

### Continued development

In the future this app could use a function to reply to comments and rate or "thumbs up" comments for more social interaction. I think also a user page might be helpful to make it more social.

### Useful resources

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.jsÂ® is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Used to get a general and quick layout of my HTML to build upon.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Used in my JS coding to link all the pages and routes and database.
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/assocs/) - Used to make MySQL more streamlined and easier to maneuver through databases.
- [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) - Used to create and seed my database.
- [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) - Used to make templates for my front end to "switch" between.
